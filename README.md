<h1 align='center'> LHC-Particle-Beam-Detection-for-CERN </h1>

My final year BSc Physics project seen me lead a team of 4, tasked with providing CERN with cutting edge particle beam loss monitors for deployment in the LHC. This was accomplished through providing a statistical evaluation, a presentation and regular stake holder meetings. My team was awarded a commendation for this report.
